<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University.

From 2024 to 2025, I conducted research on the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in fraud detection and graph attacks, under the supervision of Associate Professor Dawei Cheng at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University.

My research interest includes Deep Learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Currently, I am focusing my efforts on Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for multi-task learning applications.
