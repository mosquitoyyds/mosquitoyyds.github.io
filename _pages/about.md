# Welcome! 
I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/eng/).

From 2024 to 2025, I conducted research on the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in fraud detection and graph attacks, under the supervision of Associate Professor [Dawei Cheng](http://cs1.tongji.edu.cn/~dawei/) at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University.

My research interest includes Deep Learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Currently, I am focusing my efforts on Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for multi-task learning applications.
